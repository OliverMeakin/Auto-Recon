        <h3>Finds real matches</h3>
        <p>
          Pairs and subset-matches transactions that net to zero within a configurable grouping
          (account, vendor, entity, project, or any custom key),
          with optional spillover logic across periods.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Enforces configurable rules</h3>
        <p>
          Supports many-to-one, many-to-many, and one-to-one matching,
          with rule-based constraints to prevent invalid combinations
          and surface edge cases for review instead of forcing matches.

        <h3>Produces an audit trail</h3>
        <p>
          Writes match status back to the working sheet,
          appends cleared groups to an append-only audit log,
          and generates a detailed trace output for transparency and troubleshooting.
