# Recon App

Recon App is an Excel-native reconciliation automation tool built with Office Scripts.

## What it does
- Role-aware matching: ADP payments vs offshore sources (KPS/MGA/EIB)
- SS and MED type locking (never mix)
- MED requires exactly one offshore offset
- Writes Status back to Recon
- Appends matched groups to Cleared (append-only)
- Produces a debug trace sheet for audit / troubleshooting
